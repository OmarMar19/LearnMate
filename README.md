## 📌 Overview  
Learners often struggle to find reliable explanations after completing a course. **LearnMate** solves this by acting as a **virtual teaching assistant**, trained on custom course datasets to ensure relevance and accuracy.  

Key features include:  
- **Fine-Tuned LLM**  
  - Fine-tuned **LLaMA 3.1** on a custom Q&A dataset built from course material.  
  - Tailored responses aligned with specific course content.  

- **Baseline Comparison**  
  - Implemented **Sentence Transformers** as a baseline model.  
  - Benchmarked performance, showing improvement with fine-tuned LLaMA.  

- **Enhanced Learning Support**  
  - Provides context-aware answers to student queries.  
  - Reduces confusion and strengthens post-course engagement.
